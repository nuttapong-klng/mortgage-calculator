# Mortgage Calculator

This is a simple mortgage calculator written in Java. It calculates the monthly mortgage payment based on the principal amount, annual interest rate, and loan period.

## How to Run

1.  **Compile the Java code:**
    ```bash
    javac src/Main.java
    ```

2.  **Run the compiled code:**
    ```bash
    java -cp src Main
    ```

The program will then prompt you for the following information:

*   **Principal:** The principal loan amount (between 1,000 and 1,000,000).
*   **Annual Interest Rate:** The annual interest rate (between 0 and 30).
*   **Period (Years):** The loan period in years (between 1 and 30).

Once you have entered all the required information, the program will calculate and display your monthly mortgage payment.
